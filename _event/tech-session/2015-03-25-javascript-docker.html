     More and more Java developers face the challenge of working with Javascript. This presentation will cover my learning curve, the biggest misconceptions I had about the language and how I managed to cope with the Javascript ecosystem coming from a long years of predominantly Java background. My examples are from my experience with the AngularJS framework but they cover general Javascript patterns.
