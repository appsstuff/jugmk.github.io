<h2>Regular Meetings</h2>
 
<p>
We believe that the live communication between the members of out community is a vital part in the development of JUGMK. That's why we meet regularly every two weeks in a more relaxed atmosphere, where we're giving the members to get to know each other and exchange opinions, knowledge and experiences on various subjects.    
</p>

<p>
    These meetings are the place to make contact, ranging from Java enthusiasts to experienced Java proffesionals.
</p>
<p>
    By default, these meetings are fun :)    
</p>
<p>
    Check the information on this site and the announcements on the mailing list for more detailed info on the location and the time of our next meeting.

<h2>Technical Sessions</h2>
<p>
    One of the main goals of JUGMK is the acquisition of new experiences and knowledge related to Java and the IT in general. One of the better ways of achieving that goal is by technical conferences with speakers from our community, as well as proven abroad speakers from our fellow JUGs.    
</p>
<p>
    Currently, we are in the process of organizing one such conference, more details will follow soon.    
</p>
<p>
    If you want to be one of the speakers at one of out conferences, don't hesitate to write us on <a href="mailto:presentations@jug.mk">presentations@jug.mk</a>.
