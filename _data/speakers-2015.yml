    In 2005, I graduated from ETH in Zurich, Switzerland with a Master in Software Engineering. 
    I was living a happy life as developer at Netcetera, until I felt the need to learn something new 
    and attended an advanced study course in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where I learned that not 
    just technology, but also design and psychology are important. 
    For more than 3 years now, I am the Head of Netcetera's User Experience Office and spend my time 
    doing User Research, Sketching, Prototyping and Usability Testing.

  title: "Thinking reactive"
  abstract: >
    Over the past few years, web-applications have started to play an increasingly important role in our lives. We expect them to be always available and the data to be always fresh.<br/>
    As reactive architectures gain in popularity, more and more developers find themselves faced with the challenge of "thinking reactive".  It's a lot about letting go of old imperative and stateful habits of typical programming, and forcing your brain to work in a different paradigm.<br/> 
    In this talk we will distinguish between reactive programming, reactive application, functional reactive programming. It will be a quick introduction of what is reactive application and what reactive programming is.<br/>
    At the end we will see a reactive application demo.

    This presentation will explain the purpose of testing wing of the development, how people decided that it's a good idea to have it and what outcome usually has. A bit of context into agile testing and how this makes your life easier as a whole team, but requires a very well defined process.<br/> 
    It will explain the basics of the testing process in order to see what can be best auomated, and a few methods and principles QAs use to simplify their tests, and that are also used in creating test data and valuable test cases. <br/>
    Then we will take a practical case of implementing automation into a project and how this is done, what you need to have in mind when you choose your tools, how they inntegrate together and who's responsibility each step should be. Basically how to make your automation framework.<br/>
    In the end i will present how Selenium actually works and and what is all about, presenting the library and the infrastructure, with a couple of examples. <br/>
    And 5-10 minutes for questions and open discussions.

  title: "Monads in Javascript?"

    Javascript has taken over the world and among its other traits it's supposed to be a functional programming language. Does this mean now we can use our favorite patterns in our daily jobs? I have taken the journey of understanding how Monads can live in Javascript only to find out we are already using them everyday.In this presentation I want to share my experience with Monads - the Javascript way.<br/>
    I'll start by shortly explaining in plain words what Monads are so that every programmer can understand regardless of their preferred language. Then I will showcase through few examples how they can be implemented in Javascript and why should we use them. And finally I will present where they are already used and give you references of where the community is at on this topic.
