JavaSkop (initially JavaDay) is a one day Java Community Conference organized
by [jug.mk](http://jug.mk). It started as a small event with local speakers in 
2009, and last time, it grew to a whole-day community conference with two 
parallel tracks, international speakers and more than 300 visitors. 

## Let's do that again
