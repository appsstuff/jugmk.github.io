    In 2005, I graduated from ETH in Zurich, Switzerland with a Master in Software Engineering. 
    I was living a happy life as developer at Netcetera, until I felt the need to learn something new 
    and attended an advanced study course in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where I learned that not 
    just technology, but also design and psychology are important. 
    For more than 3 years now, I am the Head of Netcetera's User Experience Office and spend my time 
    doing User Research, Sketching, Prototyping and Usability Testing.
