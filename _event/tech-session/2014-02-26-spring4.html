    <p>The next generation of the popular Spring Framework was announced last December. After almost 4 years after the release of version 3, the framework is getting an upgrade. It is focusing on the future with support for Java SE 8 and Java EE 7. The new enterprise features in the framework as well as new programming models are leveraging the JDK 8 language features and APIs.</p>
    <p>
        This talk will cover support for lambda expressions and method references against Spring callback interfaces, JSR-310 Date-Time value types for Spring data binding and formatting, Spring's new @Conditional mechanism for activation of bean definitions, and a new WebSocket endpoint model. Spring 4.0's changes in the enterprise APIs add support for JMS 2.0, JPA 2.1, Bean Validation 1.1, Servlet 3.1, JCache, and JSR-236 concurrency.?Additionally, an outlook will be provided for the 4.1 release which is scheduled for August.
