  title: "Managers and Customers - The Missing Manual"
  abstract: >
    The goal of the talk is to provide developers with information about how non-technical managers and customers tick and how to deal with them in daily project work.
    Developers need to work together with non-technical people. And the better this collaboration works, the more successful the projects are. It is helpful for both parties to understand each other, know what motivates and drives the other side, what they care about.
    In my career I gathered some insights that I would like to share with the audience. This experiences come from both working as a software developer and IT architect with non-technical people and from becoming a part-time manager myself."

  title: "How I learned to stop worrying and love the monolith"
  abstract: >
    With so many advocates of both the microservices-first and monolith-first approaches, it's important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both architectural styles. 
    With these two being at two opposite sides of the spectrum, could there be a middle ground?
    We will explore the concept of structured monoliths by visiting several topics such as layered architecture (and the damages it causes), Ports and Adapters architecture as its alternative and Domain-Driven Design's Bounded Context pattern that can help us create components which can one day become microservices.

    Microservices are not something that you need to jump into immediately. 
    It is a hidden trap for small teams and young companies. 
    Luckily we survived that trap, so we can share the story with you. 
    Business and Team organizations should follow this architecture, which motivated us to spend a huge amount of time in the last 3 years to transform our Company into Microservices-based organization.

    <h4>Jigsaw in a nutshell.</h4>
    Reliable configuration and strong encapsulation are the two key values of the project. 
    How are they achieved and what this means? This is a promise for better architecture of the platform itself and brings greater security, integrity and scallability.

    <h4>The problem with the classpath</h4>
    Whatever you know about the structure of your system the classpath erases it. 
    With modules you are telling the compiler and the VM about the structure of your system and they use this information.

    <h4>Modularity Basic concepts</h4>
    Laying the foundations for this topic I will define what are modules, what is unnamed module, what is automatic module and how are now the rules of readability and accessibility changed. 
    Implied readability will be discussed shortly.

    <h4>Migration of the existing code</h4>
    Two approaches for migration will be shown conceptually, top down and bottom up migration.

    Coding example of course ;)

    Developers these days want to forget about infrastructure and simply build great scalable apps quickly. 
    This just got easier and I'll prove it to you by live coding an application that you can interact with during the talk (bring your laptop and/or smartphone).

    While having fun playing with what I code, you'll learn how to easily build any web application - from simple SPAs trough a full micro-service architecture to complex enterprise applications.

  title: "How Reactive do we need to be"
  abstract: >
    My greatest passion in programming are functional languages, the languages that were believed to be the future of AI. 
    Now they are prevailing in all other areas and concepts like Reactive, Immutable, Stateless are becoming part of our daily work. 
    Which is great, but the question is how Reactive do we really need to be. 
    I want to give my "point de vue" based on my experience with using Javascript frontend technologies for big enterprise projects.

    While it is easy to be courageous and innovative when doing small start up projects in reality most of us still have to do big projects that need to stay stable and useful for many years. 
    It is amazing that now enterprise projects are opening up to novelty but how can we really survive the turmoil and take advantage of the good and avoid the volatile and bad.

    I want to try to go about this topic in a pragmatic way drawing from my experience and cured by my passion for functional programming and showcase and compare some of the advantages and setbacks in the most popular Javascript frameworks.

  title: "Monads in Javascript?"
  abstract: >
    Microservices are hot topic these days. 
    And it's not just another hype, but the reality - the new  deployment and delivery model of scaling and maintaining single app features lead to completely new development model.

    Most of the platform vendors from the Java space followed the trends and came up with powerful products in that space. 
    As always Java EE was accused for being late for the party. 
    Individual vendors have their own solutions, but they are still far from standard. 
    The MicroProfile initiative is a step in the right direction. 
    There vendors work together to define what a microservice runtime is and implement it on top of standard technologies.

    Join this session to learn more about the initiative, its current state and future outlooks.
