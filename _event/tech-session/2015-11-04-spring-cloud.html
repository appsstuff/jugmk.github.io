     Spring Cloud is a relatively new sub-project from Spring/Pivotal. It provides tools and integrations for 3rd party tools for building applications on cloud platforms. 
        Some of the components of Spring Cloud might also be useful in "normal" applications, i.e. applications that do not necessarily run in a cloud.
        This presentation will give a high-level introduction to Spring Cloud and some of the components of Spring Cloud. 
        This includes components from the Spring Cloud project itself as well as integrations that Spring Cloud provides for a few Netflix OSS tools: Spring Cloud Config, Spring Cloud Bus, Spring Cloud Security, Netflix Hystrix, Netflix Ribbon, Netflix Eureka and Netflix Zuul. 
        For every component, there will be a quick introduction, an explanation what the component does and how it relates to other components.
