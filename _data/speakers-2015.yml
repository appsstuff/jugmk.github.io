    In 2005, Marcel graduated from ETH in Zurich, Switzerland with a Master in Software Engineering. 
    He was living a happy life as developer at Netcetera, until he felt the need to learn something new 
    and attended an advanced study course in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where he learned that not 
    just technology, but also design and psychology are important. 
    For more than 3 years now, Marcel is the Head of Netcetera's User Experience Office and spends his time 
    doing User Research, Sketching, Prototyping and Usability Testing. 
  title: "May the UX force be with you"
  abstract: >
    Angular, React, ECMAscript6 and all the other cool and trendy frameworks and languages are all great from a technical perspective, but here's the thing: the user doesn't care.<br/> 
    What he or she does care about is that software is intuitive, easy to use, looks good and feels good.<br/>
    So you should not just care about the technology, but also about the User Experience (UX).<br/>
    In this talk, I will give you a short introduction into UX and User Centered Design (UCD), based on examples from my daily work.<br/>
    I will discuss topics like Personas, Prototyping and Usability Testing, and hope that at the end of the talk, the UX force will be a bit stronger with you.

  title: "Finally a modular Java"
  abstract: >
    We've been waiting for this for a long time. A java runtime (and JDK) that can be custom-tailored to our needs. No more a JRE that is 100mb. And now a way to bundle our app with the JRE. And no more jar hell. And a reusable VM. This sounds too good to be true, but that's what promised in JDK 9.

  title: "JS Modularization - The Restaurant approach"
  abstract: >
    What to do when you have existing monolith angular application and you need to create several app releases for different affiliates / brands with an accent on:<br/> 
    most of the business functionality is the same <br/>
    reuse the core / common functionality <br/>
    easily extend / modify the business and common functionality<br/> 
    do it in 2 weeks.<br/>
    The reason why we want to to make presentation on this topic is to spread the word about modular architecture in Javascript applications. Most of the applications that are built in AngularJS nowadays are based on the structure that is provided by Google. This approach is not suitable when your project needs to grow and continuously change / extend. We'd like to help others being in similar situation as us: having different affiliates / brands for same product.<br/>
    Our solution was to use ng-boilerplate for project structure and use grunt + git for distributed code base of the modules. We used restaurant idea for presenting modularization in order to simplify the idea about the buzz word "modularization". Hear about the alternatives and the obstacles we had in this talk.

  title: "Thinking reactive"
  abstract: >
    Over the past few years, web-applications have started to play an increasingly important role in our lives. We expect them to be always available and the data to be always fresh.<br/>
    As reactive architectures gain in popularity, more and more developers find themselves faced with the challenge of "thinking reactive".  It's a lot about letting go of old imperative and stateful habits of typical programming, and forcing your brain to work in a different paradigm.<br/> 
    In this talk we will distinguish between reactive programming, reactive application, functional reactive programming. It will be a quick introduction of what is reactive application and what reactive programming is.<br/>
    At the end we will see a reactive application demo.

A bit of context into agile testing and how this makes your life easier as a whole team, but requires a very well defined process.<br/> 
    It will explain the basics of the testing process in order to see what can be best auomated, and a few methods and principles QAs use to simplify their tests, and that are also used in creating test data and valuable test cases. <br/>
    Then we will take a practical case of implementing automation into a project and how this is done, what you need to have in mind when you choose your tools, how they inntegrate together and who's responsibility each step should be. Basically how to make your automation framework.<br/>
    In the end i will present how Selenium actually works and and what is all about, presenting the library and the infrastructure, with a couple of examples. <br/>
    And 5-10 minutes for questions and open discussions.

    I'll start by shortly explaining in plain words what Monads are so that every programmer can understand regardless of their preferred language. Then I will showcase through few examples how they can be implemented in Javascript and why should we use them. And finally I will present where they are already used and give you references of where the community is at on this topic.

    Android evolution is happening. The software matures and the hardware is getting better and cheaper. But why this happens and what does it mean to us? What possibilities will there be in the future with Android that don't exist now?
    Medical industry, although highly standardized, is reinventing itself. Health trackers are everywhere. Wearable sensors are blooming. But do we need a sensor for everything? My app will measure heart pulse rate on multiple people simultaneously, in real time using only latest Android software and hardware. This is never done before and no sensor can do that. 
    Standing on the shoulders of giants, I will explain how the human cardio system works and why measuring this vital sign is so important. But how the app performs it without touching users... Video face detection and custom face tracking - all there. How I managed to gain huge speed by doing thing in native, JNI way, switching between data structures and using all processor cores on the device. But there is more... signal processing and filtering. Do you think that that is too much for your pocket Android device to handle. Is it? I say no... Android is very powerful if used in proper way. It is the future of the software of things. I am looking forward to explain you how this is used in streaming music application that can generate playlist and stream songs by your heart pulse.
