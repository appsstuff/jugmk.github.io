    for Developers" (a developer-friendly guide to software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with 
    agility). He is also the creator of the C4 software architecture model, which is a simple approach to creating

  abstract: >
    The software development industry has made huge leaps in recent years; with agile, lean, software craftsmanship, 
    evolutionary design and microservices being just a few of the buzzwords we throw around. Despite this, software 
    development teams are often more chaotic than they are self-organising, with the resulting code being more of a 
    mess than was perhaps anticipated. Successful software projects aren't just about good code though, and sometimes 
    you need to step away from the IDE for a few moments to see the bigger picture. This session is about that bigger 
    picture and is aimed at software developers who want to learn more about software architecture, technical 
    leadership and the balance with agility. This talk will debunk some of the common myths as we look at five things 
    every developer should know about software architecture; a guide to software architecture on modern software 
    projects that's pragmatic rather than academic and lightweight rather than "enterprisey".
