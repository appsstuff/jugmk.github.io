  abstract: >
    <p>The social graph of Facebook is the most popular application for a graph database. In addition, there are far more exciting applications, such as spatial data, financial trail, indexing, and others. If you combine different graphs, you are able to evaluate those together with the algorithms known from the graph theory. As a graph, a domain can often be easier and more natural designed. This talk introduces the topic of graph databases and shows how to implement mediated models with large, complex and highly connected data with Neo4j. Subsequently, topics like querying, indexing, import / export are considered as well.
    </p>
    <p>After the introduction, everyone will be able to do the first (guided) steps with Neo4j and the Cypher query language.</p>
