Java Day is an event that [jug.mk](http://jug.mk) organizes for the past 5 years. From the
small group of enthusiastic presenters in EU-info center in Skopje to a full
7h filled with lectures at a cinema hall JavaDay has grown to be one of the
leading technical events in the area.

## What has changed over the years and what the future holds 

We started out as a small event with only local speakers in 2009 happening
each year since then. In 2013, we had 1 person outside of Macedonia. The need
for diversity was becoming more apparent. 2014 was the year we went fully
international with 6 speakers coming from Switzerland, Serbia, and Bulgaria.
We had participants in the audience from all the neighboring countries. The
Bulgarian JUG presence was a great addition and an awesome connection between
our JUGS.

## The keynote 

[Corsin Decurtins](https://twitter.com/corsin), CTO of Netcetera gave an awesome talk on "how to become a great developer".
To quote the abstract:

> At the core, the job of a software developer is and has always been the
same: writing good, elegant, sustainable and bug-free software that exceeds
the expectations of your clients. But the context in which we do our job is
changing and with it the skills required to be a great software developer. In
this talk, I want to go through a couple of things that I think make the
difference between a developer and a great developer. This includes some
technical skills and practices, but also non-technical things that you might
not consider relevant for a developer at first. 

The talk was extremely well perceived by the audience. This is very visible by
the survey where he got the best reviews also by the fact the we were
approached multiple times by persons telling us we need more of this.


## Why this type of events are important to the community 

Conferences help you get in touch with other like-minded persons. They keep
you up to date with modern technologies and interesting concepts.  Also it is
great for the companies where it enables them to reach narrowly selected
audience, they get to promote himself and be recognizable.

## Female participation @ JavaDay

This year we also had our first female speaker Raluca Breaur one of the
organizers or the Agile meetups and Java User Group in Iasi, Romania. She had
an awesome talk "Caching â€“ oldie but goldie"  with great analogies for caching
systems.

It is unfortunate that after so many JavaDay this was our first
female speaker especially since the from the side of the attendees we had more
than 30%.  Few weeks later a nice initiative was started by forming a local
chapter of JDutchess. Few of them were also involved in the organization and
we extremely grateful. I am just hoping that next years event will have lot
more of this group.

## What's next 

Hopefully sometime in the near future we are gonna get the video recordings
processed and uploaded to Parleys. We continue next year and try to make the
event better. Going bigger is also an option but we are not sure if that is
the right direction. We definitely wanna raise the organization level and the
quality of the event. Special thanks to the 7 sponsors that supported up and
without them the event could not be free.

We had a little competition about choosing the next name for JavaDay so next
year we might be called Javalicious.
