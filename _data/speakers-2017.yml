  title: "Managers and Customers - The Missing Manual"
  abstract: >
    <p>The goal of the talk is to provide developers with information about how non-technical managers and customers tick and how to deal with them in daily project work.</p>
    
    <p>Developers need to work together with non-technical people. And the better this collaboration works, the more successful the projects are. 
    It is helpful for both parties to understand each other, know what motivates and drives the other side, what they care about.</p>
    
    <p>In my career I gathered some insights that I would like to share with the audience. 
    This experiences come from both working as a software developer and IT architect with non-technical people and from becoming a part-time manager myself.</p>

  title: "How I learned to stop worrying and love the monolith"
  abstract: >
    <p>
    With so many advocates of both the microservices-first and monolith-first approaches, it's important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both architectural styles. 
    With these two being at two opposite sides of the spectrum, could there be a middle ground?
    </p>
    <p>
    We will explore the concept of structured monoliths by visiting several topics such as layered architecture (and the damages it causes), Ports and Adapters architecture as its alternative and Domain-Driven Design's Bounded Context pattern that can help us create components which can one day become microservices.

    Microservices are not something that you need to jump into immediately.

    Luckily we survived that trap, so we can share the story with you. 
    Business and Team organizations should follow this architecture, which motivated us to spend a huge amount of time in the last 3 years to transform our Company into Microservices-based organization.

  title: "Java 9 - Project Jigsaw"

    <h4>Jigsaw in a nutshell.</h4>
    Reliable configuration and strong encapsulation are the two key values of the project. 
    How are they achieved and what this means? This is a promise for better architecture of the platform itself and brings greater security, integrity and scallability.

    <h4>The problem with the classpath</h4>
    Whatever you know about the structure of your system the classpath erases it. 
    With modules you are telling the compiler and the VM about the structure of your system and they use this information.

    <h4>Modularity Basic concepts</h4>
    Laying the foundations for this topic I will define what are modules, what is unnamed module, what is automatic module and how are now the rules of readability and accessibility changed. 
    Implied readability will be discussed shortly.

    <h4>Migration of the existing code</h4>
    Two approaches for migration will be shown conceptually, top down and bottom up migration.

    Coding example of course ;)

    <p>
    My greatest passion in programming are functional languages, the languages that were believed to be the future of AI. 
    Now they are prevailing in all other areas and concepts like Reactive, Immutable, Stateless are becoming part of our daily work. 
    Which is great, but the question is how Reactive do we really need to be. 
    I want to give my "point de vue" based on my experience with using Javascript frontend technologies for big enterprise projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    While it is easy to be courageous and innovative when doing small start up projects in reality most of us still have to do big projects that need to stay stable and useful for many years. 
    It is amazing that now enterprise projects are opening up to novelty but how can we really survive the turmoil and take advantage of the good and avoid the volatile and bad.
    </p>
    <p>
    I want to try to go about this topic in a pragmatic way drawing from my experience and cured by my passion for functional programming and showcase and compare some of the advantages and setbacks in the most popular Javascript frameworks.

  title: "Recommender Systems: What, Why, How"
  abstract: >
    <p>
    This talk will give a short overview of what a Recommender System is, and the decisions one has to take into account when designing one. 
    Then we will go into more details on the general concept of a recommendation engine, why do we need one, the used algorithm (collaborative filtering, factorization techniques), its' nature (personalized / non-personalized), the valuation metrics, and the learning procedure. 
    A couple of key points will also be addressed, such as the importance of implicit user feedback, the integration of the engine into the service, and the unavoidable pitfalls.
    </p>
    <h4>WHAT</h4>
    In the introductory part of the talk, we will first see what a Recommender System is. 
    In what follows, a solid understanding of what the purpose of such a system is, will be established. 
    Also, a short summary will be given, of what it’s role is, and what is outside it’s scope.
    <h4>WHY</h4>
    Next, a short requirements list will be presented, to showcase features that we take for granted, present in almost all of the modern online platforms, which are all powered by a recommendation engine of some kind.
    <h4>HOW</h4>
    In this longest part of the talk, I will mostly focus on answering this question: How do we integrate a recommendation engine into a new service, or a product? 
    A short overview of the few most popular techniques will be given, alongside the key decisions one has to make when designing the recommendation process. 
    Also, a few implied points will be discussed, which directly influence, or are a consequence from the design decisions.
    <h4>Closing:</h4>
    In this part, I will give a couple of examples of well designed recommendation engines, and their seamless integration into the core products.

  title: "How to deploy Dockerized applications to AWS ElasticBeanstalk"
  abstract: >
    <p>
    Perhaps the easiest way  to run your application at AWS as a multi Docker container app is to use Amazon ElasticBeanstalk. 
    It allows you to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud and let Amazon care about the infrastructure magic.
    In short all you need to do is to create an application in Elastic Beanstalk, configure its environment and provide an archive with Dockerrun.aws.json file. This is where you define which docker images should be used and how they need to be configured when deploying your app.
    Continuous integration? Yes, this can be automated, Jenkins is there to help with lots of AWS plugins (so you don’t need to know any Groovy). 
    In my presentation I'll share my experience of using ElasticBeanstalk and automating deployment with Jenkins.

  title: "Spring Boot SSO in 15 min"
  abstract: >
    Spring Boot SSO implemented with Oauth2 and Zuul proxy, with .jdbc() instead of .inMemory(), focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web and desktop apps, mobile and IoT devices. 
    Implementation .inMemory() will be faster, but if multiple clients are consuming this then it is better to have it in .jdbc(). 
    Will use an OAuth2 server as the authenticator, so that we can also use it to grant tokens for the backend resource server using MySQL as client, user and token store. 
    The goal is to work around CORS and the Same Origin Policy restriction of the browser and allow the UI to call the API even though they don't share the same origin using Zuul proxy.

  title: "Quick introduction of state management in JavaScript apps using Redux"
  abstract: >
    Since the introduction of the modularization in the JavaScript world, we have faced countless of issues. 
    One very common problem, especially in the component driven development, is how can we share data between modules/components. 
    Facebook had the same issue when they moved their UI to React. 
    In order to solve this problem, they started implementing the Flux application architecture. 
    Redux, on the other hand, has evolved around the idea of Flux, and is becoming the go-to tool in a React application. 
    It was created as a state management library with minimal API, but with the ability to be implemented in various features like hot reloading, universal apps, etc.
