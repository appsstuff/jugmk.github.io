    Continuous delivery is a practice by many companies in order to release software often and get feedback sooner. As a concept, continuous delivery is widely accepted. However, in practice it is different. What are the necessary steps in order to create a stable continuous delivery pipeline? How can you deliver value quickly and delight your customer? How hard is it to setup a pipeline? What are prerequisites for continuous delivery? This talk will try to answer these questions, and provide some guidance about best software development practices, that can lead to a successful implementation of continuous delivery on your project. We will look into Snap-CI and how hard it is to setup a continuous delivery pipeline for repositories hosted on GitHub.
